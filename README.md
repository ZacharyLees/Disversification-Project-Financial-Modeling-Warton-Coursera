# Disversification-Project-Financial-Modeling-Warton-Coursera
This is the final project of the Warton Coursera course. This was created for the Business and Financial Modeling Specilization Certificate.

It goes into detail in regards to the importance of diversification. The excel file shows techniques of creating graphs, efficient frontier graphs, descriptive statistics, and regression.
The power point explains the risk involved with smaller portfolios and the lower volatility of larger portfolios, particularly those including bond funds, which are inversely correlated to equities. This allows for lower standard deviation and thus higher Sharpe ratios.

The course goes over modeling such as algebraic equations, optimization, probabilistic model choosing, monte carlo simulations, risk modeling, portfolio allocation, excel: solver, data analysis, as well as going over balance sheets, income statements, cash flow sheets, etc.
